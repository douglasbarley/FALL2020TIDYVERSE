## Kiva Loans

Kiva loans are extremely small loans, called microloans, made to entrepreneurs
who need small seed loans to start their businesses. The loans are made in order
to help better communities one entrepreneur at a time. The dataset used in this 
vignette consists of a set of Kiva loans made in calendar year 2016 around the 
globe. For the purpose of this vignette, the loans data was pared down to make
the file size < 25 MB.
```{r }
kiva <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/douglasbarley/FALL2020TIDYVERSE/TidyverseVignette/kiva_loans.csv")

library(tidyverse)
glimpse(kiva)
```

The 2016 data includes 197,236 observations of 14 variables.

## Tidyverse group_by() function

The Tidyverse contains many packages that are useful in R for cleaning and 
exploring data. When faced with a fairly long dataset, such as the Kiva set in 
this example, it is useful to be able to count the data in a single column while
grouping the counts according to discrete values in that column. The `group_by` 
function in the `dplyr` corner of the Tidyverse helps to do just that. This helps
a programmer quickly explore what is in the data.

For example, it could be useful to know which countries received the most loans.
```{r message= FALSE}
countries <- data.frame(kiva) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
      summarize(count_loans = n())

head(countries)
```

## Visualizing the results

Once we have a concise count of loans by country, it is helpful to be able to 
visualize
all of the results in a single graphic. The `ggplot()` function, also part of the
Tidyverse, is very helpful in
the visualization realm.
```{r}
ggplot(data = countries) + geom_col(aes(x = country, y = count_loans)) +
  ggtitle("Loans Disbursed by Country") +
  coord_flip() +  
  ylab('Loan Count') +
  xlab('Country') 

```

There are so many countries where loans were disbursed that it is difficult to 
read each country's name. In order to simplify the listing and visualizations, 
let's identify the top 10 countries that received loans.
```{r}
countries_top10 <- head(arrange(countries,desc(count_loans)), n = 10)
countries_top10
```

Now we can graph the top 10 countries that received loans.
```{r}
ggplot(data = countries_top10) + geom_col(aes(x = reorder(country, count_loans), count_loans)) +
  ggtitle("Loans Disbursed by Country") +
  coord_flip() +  
  ylab('Loan Count') +
  xlab('Country')
```

That's much more legible! Now we can see that the Philippines received the most 
Kiva loans of any country in 2016.

## Tidyverse EXTEND

Orli Khaimova extending Douglas' vignette

In order to see the order of which countries received the most loans more efficiently,
we can sort the data in descending order, from greatest to least. We can use the 
`arrange` function from the `dplyr` package. It orders the rows of a data frame by
the specified column. By default, it sorts from least to greatest, so we would 
have to specify descending order. Furthermore, a `by_group` argument can be 
used if we want to group variables.

```{r}
countries <- countries %>%
  arrange(desc(count_loans))

head(countries)
```

From here, we can see that Phillipines, Kenya, and Cambodia have the most loans.


We can also look further into those countries to see what the loans were taken 
out for. To do so, we  will:

* `add_count` to create a new column and find counts of variables group-wise
  + It is equivalent to `group_by` and `mutate` used together
* `mutate` to add an extra column in the data set with ranks
* `dense_rank` to return the rank of rows 
  + It will rank the rows, in descending order, with no gaps. This means when 
    there are ties, it will give it the same rank.
* `filter` to subset rows using column values
  + In this case, we are selecting the top 5 ranks or groups with largest loan 
    counts
* `as.factor` from `base` to factor the sector column
* `group_by`, `mutate`, and `ungroup` to find the counts for each sector by 
  country
* `group_by`, `mutate`, and `ungroup` to give ranks to each sector by country
* `filter` to find the top 5 sectors for each country

We then proceed to create a graph for the top 5 sectors in those 5 countries. We
can see the distribution of the loans by their sector types. We can use 
`facet_Wrap` to create a separate graph for each country.


```{r}
top_5_countries <- kiva %>%
  add_count(country, name = "count_loans") %>%
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(desc(count_loans))) %>%
  filter(rank %in% 1:5) %>%
  mutate(sector = as.factor(sector)) %>%
  group_by(country, sector) %>%
  mutate(sector_count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(sector_rank = dense_rank(desc(sector_count))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(sector_rank %in% 1:5)
  

ggplot(top_5_countries) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = sector, y = count_loans, fill = country), stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~country, scales = "free", ncol = 2) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Activities for Loans") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), legend.position = "none") +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("Sector")
```

# Description
This assignment is about getting familiar with two or more Tidyverse packages. So, I am going to write a vignette using readr, dplyr , and stringr which are part of the core tidyverse packages used for data analysis.

# Data
For this assignment, I found a dataset from kaggle.com about the 500 greatest songs of all time. I am going to use it to practice tidyverse packages as states in the description part. The data is large for display and might cause some issue in attemptin to display all output. 

Below is sample of code...for full view, please use web link or Github link.

```{r }
# load the csv file which has all the variable.

Top_500Songs <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asmozo24/DATA607_Tidyverse-CREATE-Assignmen/main/Top%20500%20Songs.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# file to big, cleaning/removing the column I don't need
Top_500Songs <- Top_500Songs [, -2]
# saving the new csv file 
write.csv(Top_500Songs,'Top_500Songs.csv')

#view the details of top_500songs
glimpse(Top_500Songs)

# let's check if there is a missing value in a specific column
# return 06 rows with empty values...tempted to delete data but will not do it now....no need
Top_500Songs %>% 
  filter( is.na(streak) | streak == "") 
# another way
filter(Top_500Songs, is.na(streak) | streak == "")
filter(Top_500Songs, !grepl("weeks", streak))
 
# Being in the top 500 greatest songs of all time, I will assum the song hits the hit parade of billboard for few months...lets check that
Top_500Songs %>%

# TidyVerse Recipe CREATE

Name: Arushi Arora

#### Introduction:
The core tidyverse package includes "readr", "tidyr" and "dplyr"
- `readr` provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data
- `tidyr` provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable
- `dplyr` provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation

#### Approach:
Read the csv for the article https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-like-their-steak/ published on Five Thirty Eight from Github using `readr`. Rename all the variables using `dplyr` package and remove the first row with no real reponses. Mutate the variable type to factor using the function `mutate` for further analysis
 
#### Conclusion:
The dataset was imported and cleaned using packages in TidyVerse

---

#### SYNTAX
- Import CSV from Github
    ```
    urlfile="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/steak-survey/steak-risk-survey.csv"

    steakdata<- readr::read_csv(url(urlfile))
    ```

- Rename variables

    ```
    steakdata1 = dplyr::rename(steakdata, 
    "lottery" = "Consider the following hypothetical situations: <br>In Lottery A, you have a 50% chance of success, with a payout of $100. <br>In Lottery B, you have a 90% chance of success, with a payout of $20. <br><br>Assuming you have $10 to bet, would you play Lottery A or Lottery B?", 
    "smoke_cigs" = "Do you ever smoke cigarettes?" ,
    "drink_alcohol" = "Do you ever drink alcohol?", 
    "gamble" = "Do you ever gamble?",
    "skydiving" = "Have you ever been skydiving?",
    "overspeeding" = "Do you ever drive above the speed limit?",
    "cheat_patner" = "Have you ever cheated on your significant other?",
    "eat_steak" = "Do you eat steak?",
    "steak_prep" = "How do you like your steak prepared?",
    "hh_income" = "Household Income",
    "location" = "Location (Census Region)")
    ```
- Remove first row

  ```
    steakdata2 <- steakdata1[-c(1), ]
  ```

- Code for populating the tables from .csv file stored locally
    ```
    steakdata3 <- steakdata2 %>% as_tibble() 

    steakdata4 <- steakdata3 %>%
    mutate(lottery = as.factor(lottery)) %>%
    mutate(smoke_cigs = as.factor(smoke_cigs)) %>%
    mutate(drink_alcohol = as.factor(drink_alcohol)) %>%
    mutate(gamble = as.factor(gamble)) %>%
    mutate(skydiving = as.factor(skydiving)) %>%
    mutate(overspeeding = as.factor(overspeeding)) %>%
    mutate(cheat_patner = as.factor(cheat_patner)) %>%

    mutate(steak_prep = as.factor(steak_prep)) %>%
    mutate(Gender = as.factor(Gender)) %>%
    mutate(Age = as.factor(Age)) %>%
    mutate(hh_income = as.factor(hh_income)) %>%

`fct_rev` relevels the levels of a factor in reverse order. In this case, I factored the regions and then used the function in order to put them in reverse alphabetical order. By doing so, I was able to print the regions alphabetically in the graph.

`geom_pointrange` graphs the interval for the average price of avocados for each region. I had to define a ymin and ymax as well. It is useful for drawing confidence intervals and in this case the range of prices.

```{r fig.height = 10, fig.width = 5}
avocados <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okhaimova/DATA-607/master/avocado.csv")

avocados$Date <- as.Date(avocados$Date)

avocados$year <- as.character(avocados$year)

#factors the regions and then using forcats, we reverse the order to make it z-a
avocados$region <- avocados$region %>%
  as.factor() %>%
  fct_rev()

avocados %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = AveragePrice, x = region, 
             ymin = AveragePrice-sd(AveragePrice), ymax = AveragePrice+sd(AveragePrice))) +

# 1. Introduction

"dplyr" is one of the tidyverse packages, and it is used for data manipulation.
In other words, it is a grammar of data manipulation providing verbs that help
to solve many problems faced in data manipulation.

"stringir" in the other is also one of a tidyverse package, and it is focused 
on string manipulation. stringir is a grammar of string manipulation. 
It provides set of functions designed to make 
working with strings easier.

Note that tidyverse is just a collection of R packages underlying same 
design philosophy, grammar, and data structure.
For more info about dplyr and stringir, read [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

Here, we are going to explore five major verbs for dplyr: 
filter(), select(), arrange(), mutate(), summarize()

and seven functions for stringr:
str_subset(), str_detect(), str_count(), str_locate(), str_extract(),
str_split(), str_replace(), str_match() 



# 2. dplyr


Throughout this part of the vignette, we make use of "student performance", a dataset containing a sample of 1000 observations of 8 variables from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) datasets.

```{r message=FALSE}
# library
library(dplyr)

# load in the dataset

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnataky/DATA-607/master/A2_Various_dataset_transformation/students_performance.csv")

# take a look at its structure
glimpse(data)

```

## filter(): picking cases by their values

The filter function picks cases by their values. Let say you want to pick students 
which math score is  100, you might write:

```{r}

data %>%
  filter(math.score == 100)

```


Similarly, if you want to pick students 
which math, writing, and reading score are all 100, you might write:

```{r}

data %>%
  filter(math.score == 100, writing.score == 100, reading.score == 100)

```


## select(): selecting variables based on their names

This second verb lets you select variables based on their names. 
Let say you want to select only the variables gender, math.score, and 
writing.score, you might write:

```{r}

data2 <- data %>%
  select(gender, writing.score, reading.score)

# Print five first students
head(data2, 6)
```


## arrange(): Reordering the cases

Arrange function lets reordering the cases in the order that you want.
Let say that you want to reorder the head of previous selected variables data frame (data2)
in descending order of students math score, you might write:

```{r}

# name the head of data2 as data3 

data3 <- head(data2, 6)

# Reorder in descending order of math score

data3 %>%
  arrange(desc(writing.score))

```


## mutate(): creating new variables that are functions of existing variables

The mutate function creates new variables that are functions of the existing variables. 
Let say you want to create "english.score" which is the average 
of writing.score and reading.score, you might write:

```{r}

data3 %>%
  mutate(english.score = (writing.score + reading.score) / 2)

```


If you are interesting in keeping only the new variable from the existing variables,
let say you want to keep only english.score and not the two others, 
you might use another function called transmuse():

```{r}

data4 <- data3 %>%
  transmute(gender, english.score = (writing.score + reading.score) / 2)

data4

```

## summarize(): summarizing multiple values to a single value

Here we will introduce the function group_by which helps grouping by the variable 
you want to do your summary. Let say you are interested in the summary of the average score
of different gender in math, you might write:

```{r}

data %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize( math_score = sum (math.score)/ n())

```



# 3. stringr


The strings functions take for arguments one vector of strings and a second argument
being the pattern. For this entire part of the vignette, 
we will use one vector of strings v and same pattern p which will be the regular
expression matching any single character that is a vowel.

```{r}

# library

library(stringr)

# Define the vector of strings

v <- c("sonority", "meal", "try", "cocktail", "cinema", "maximum", "mass")

# Pattern matching any vowel

p <- "[aeiou]"

```


## str_subset(): extracting the matching components

subset function will let you extract strings that contain vowels.

```{r}

str_subset(v, p)

```

## str_detect(): telling if there is any pattern matching


detect function detects if there is any match pattern.
If you want to detect if there is any vowel in any components of v, you might write:

```{r}

str_detect(v, p)

```

## str_count(): counting the patterns

if you want to count the number of vowels in each components of the vector of strings,
you might write:

```{r}

str_count(v, p)

```


## str_locate(): locating the position of the match

locate function helps you locate where there is the match.
Let say that you want to know the position of vowels in each component of v,
you might write:

```{r}

str_locate(v, p)

```


## str_extract(): extracting the text of the match

extract function lets you extracting the first match pattern in the string.
The following will let you extracting the first vowel in each components of v:

```{r}

str_extract(v, p)

```


## str_split(): splitting up strings

Here we are going to split up strings separated by comma in different pieces

```{r}

s <- c("dada, mum", "uncle, auntie, cousin", "men, women")
str_split(s, ",")

```


## str_replace(): replacing the matches with new text

replace function let you replace the first match pattern by the replacement 
argument that you specify. If you want to replace the first vowel in components 
of v by "/", you might write:

```{r}

str_replace(v, p, "/")

```

## str_match(): extracting parts of the match defined by parentheses

If you want to extract the letter before the first vowel in components of vector of strings v, 
you might write:

```{r}

str_match(v, "(.)[aeiou]")

```

Tidyverse CREATE Assignment - Atina Karim

In this assignment I looked at Water Quality Data from the City of Austin's online data portal:[https://data.austintexas.gov/Environment/Water-Quality-Sampling-Data/5tye-7ray](https://data.austintexas.gov/Environment/Water-Quality-Sampling-Data/5tye-7ray). The dataset contains the results of about a 1000 water quality tests performed on water bodies in Austin, in 2020.

I used tidyverse packages such as tidyr and dplyr to clean the dataset, and then visualized the data using ggplot2.

## 2. Tidyverse EXTEND


### Introduction

As this vignette is about dplyr, we are going to extend this work by adding 
different other functions of the same package.
The first part explored the functions select() and filter(), here we are going 
to add three other main verbs of dplyr: arrange(), mutate(), and summarize().

Throughout this second part of the vignette, we make use of the subset of pums
data set created using select() function as in part 1 above.


```{r}

df <- pums %>%
  select("Age","SEX","Total_Personal_Earnings","Total_Personal_Income")

```

### arrange(): Reordering the cases

Arrange function reorders the cases in the order that you want.
Let say you want to reorder pums data frame descending order, you might write: 

Arrange function lets reordering the cases in the order that you want.
Let say that you want to reorder the head of previous selected variables data frame (data2)
in descending order of students math score, you might write:

```{r}

# Reorder in descending order of math score

df %>%
  arrange(desc(Age))
```


### mutate(): creating new variables that are functions of existing variables

The mutate function creates new variables that are functions of the existing variables. 
Let say you want to create "Total_Other_Sources_of_Income" variable which is the difference
between "Total_Personal_Income" and "Total_Personal_Earnings", you might write:

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Total_Other_Sources_of_Income 
         = Total_Personal_Income - Total_Personal_Earnings)
```


Let say you are interesting in keeping only the new variable created from the existing variables,
meaning keeping only "Total_Other_Sources_of_Income" variable but neither
"Total_Personal_Income" nor "Total_Personal_Earnings",
you might use another function called transmuse():

```{r}
df1 <- df %>%
  transmute(Age, SEX, 
            Total_Other_Sources_of_Income = Total_Personal_Income - Total_Personal_Earnings )
df1
```

### summarize(): summarizing multiple values to a single value

summarize() will be used with group_by function group_by which helps grouping the data set by a variable. 
Let say you are interested in the summary of the average total personal income by sex, you might write:

```{r}

# Note that we remove missing values in the calculation to calculate the average

df %>%
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarize(average_total_income = 
              sum(Total_Personal_Income, na.rm = TRUE) / n())
```
